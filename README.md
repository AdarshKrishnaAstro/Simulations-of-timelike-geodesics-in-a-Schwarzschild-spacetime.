# Simulations-of-timelike-geodesics-in-a-Schwarzschild-spacetime.
This is a repository allowing the simulations of timelike geodesics in Schwarzschild Spacetime. Sample input data is provided for Precessing, Stable-Circular and Radially falling inward trajectories for massive particles. Please be mindful of the units.
